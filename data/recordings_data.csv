If there is a problem, you can go there and talk to them. I understand. Please raise the issue once and we will provide you with a solution."
850,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,27," Yes, sir. Once in the morning, as the market starts, any random script, proper screen recording or screen chart, whatever is available here, please mail it to us at customercarrierdarechoice.com. We will raise further concerns in the technical department. Let's check once what issues are there."
851,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,26," Yes sir, I understood. What is this issue? Where volatility is in the market but still momentum is not reflected there, it is still on the position."
852,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,25, The market is like that of Karnataka. It operates like that. It is a pan like that. It falls on it. It falls at 11.80 or 11.80. It is like that of Karnataka.
853,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,24," Yes, I understood sir. As the market opens tomorrow, please take a screenshot of a random script. And please raise it once. We will get it checked in our concerned technical department once. What is the issue regarding this sir? Yes, it is a problem. The market was like this for a long time. It was operating at that time. It was such a state that it was lying on it for 11-12 months. But now it is like this for a long time."
854,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,23," There is no movement. I understand that. It is like a movement in an application, it is still there, when there is a brutality. I am not telling you the movement, but all the movements are being told on top of it. But when I see such a script, whatever I see in 4-5 scripts, I see all the narratives. I don't know whether the movement is going up or down."
855,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,22," Are you saying that there is no bias or momentum here? Yes, there is a bit of a bias, but the attitude is good. It happens still. Yes, the volume is good. The volume of 2300 is good. The volume of 2300 is good. It held for 1 minute, 2 minutes, 15 minutes. The problem is that the rate is so high. If it is 40.04, then it is 100.04."
856,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,21," And if there is one, then it is fine. If there are two or three scripts operating, then it is fine."
857,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,20, I am not talking about that.
858,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,19," But the list of 50, bank in its pure, it is telling that it is not going to happen. But in this, your 40.04 will be as it is. Then the market depth parameters will be stuck up. It is like it is hidden. There is no movement in it. And one thing is that it is fine. But there is no success in operating in two or three screens."
859,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,18," In the market depth, the rate of your order quantity, bid, ask quantity, etc. The rates there are stuck up. There is no movement. Like there is a movement at the top, but here we are not telling any movement. The rates at the top are also stuck up. The rates at the bottom are also stuck up."
860,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,17," Yes, sir."
861,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,16," Sir, 40.04 is going on now, there is a problem of 0.15 0.15, okay Open rate is 40, high rate is 41.60 Close rate is 40.04 No sir, low is 39.60 and closing is 40. Yes, low is 39, close is 40.04, okay This is 4 parameters Is market coming in depth with that? Yes sir"
862,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,15," Okay? Yes, sir. I am playing a little on your screen."
863,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,14," Yes sir, which set? Any set, any set. For example, you have opened a bank. One bank? Yes, I have checked. Dhan Bank? Dhan Lakshmi? Dhan Lakshmi, okay, Dhan Bank."
864,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,13," In any case, you can open any sheet. Yes sir, which sheet? Any sheet, any sheet. You can ask for example, Dhan Bank has just been opened. One Bank? Yes, we will check. Dhan Bank? Dhan Lakshmi? Dhan Lakshmi, ok, Dhan Bank. Ok? Yes sir."
865,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,12, Uh...
866,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,11," I am talking about that only. The problem is that I am watching online trading cream. Whatever you open for information, the information and data pool is there. There is nothing. Can you provide a screenshot or screen recording this time? We want to check once what is the issue, sir. Can you give us the name of this?"
867,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,10," Directly, any Odin support or from there? Yes, guys, guys, guys, any app, download any app on any app,"
868,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,9," I agree if it is in one script but it is the same in 3,4,5 scripts Can you provide screen recording or something so that we can check if MRD is reflecting properly Have you downloaded any software on your application? No, I haven't downloaded Did you directly download any Odin support or anything? Yes, I downloaded Choyce app Choyce has this app"
869,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,8," But the whole scrolling is coming up, it is getting better. The market is not going up, it is getting bigger and bigger. But here volume is increasing, everything is increasing. There is no saving in the market."
870,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,7," If I operate any script, for example, I have just opened a script of Maalo Zanbank, I have opened the information. So, the data coming from the information is not operating at all. It remains the same. I call, it starts operating after a while. It remains the same. Whatever is written on the phone or on the radio, all the data remains the same."
871,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,6," What is the issue sir? The issue is that I operate and heading online from mobile. So your scoring is also coming up. Bank Nifty, Finance Nifty. All these are operating and it is all set up."
872,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,5," The problem is that they wanted to tell us about the problem. So they said that they will tell us about the problem and we can sell it online. What is the issue, sir? Please tell us. The issue is that the mobile that I operate and I do the trading online, so your scoring is also coming up, in the list, bank list, finance list. All this is being operated, it is all done."
873,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,4, Now you have to download the modern software.
874,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,3," Sir, do you want to download Odin software or you want to know about the application? I want to know about the problem. My father called me and asked me to give Odin. I said okay, I will download Odin. You want to download Odin software, sir?"
875,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,2," Yes, I have a mobile number. I operate it through a mobile app. What is it? There is a problem with the mobile number. There is a problem. I called him. I got a call from the office. I asked him about the finance and the voting. He said he didn't know. He said, call me and find out what you are doing."
876,090d2de79a4d488785405fef2d0e5a72,1," But after 26 years, I can help you as a nurse."

881,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,65," Ok, so you have not done commodity? No, but commodity costs only Rs.50 only sir. Ok, so you will call me and put me in commodity and give me more brokerage, will you do this? Yes, no sir, I will not do this. But you can request the trader to give me less brokerage in commodity which he will give you less. Ok, ok. And what you have done, you have done in derivating? Yes."
882,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,64," Madam, if we work in a dairy factory, then in the sensex, people will take more charges. So, you can talk to your RM once that I have taken more charges regarding this. So, give me less charges, they are helping you. I have done less than 10 rupees, I have done 10 rupees. Yes, so they have done it in equity, if you do not do it in commodity, then you will say for commodity, then it will be better for you."

899,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,47, Will he do it himself or I will call him and tell him?
900,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,46," Okay. Madam, if he comes one more day, he will get the census done and then he will take the data book. So, you change your password, sir. Can he do it himself or I will call him and tell him to do it?"

Sometimes. Yes, madam."
914,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,32, 50 rupees per load how much will be the cost of buying 5 dollars? 65 for buy and 65 for sale if you buy 50 rupees per load then it will be 3250 rupees then we will multiply it by 2 so it will be 6050 rupees per load it will be 6500 rupees for buy and sale
915,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,31, you have to buy 65 lot but if you see according to 10 rupees your brokerage charges that is

917,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,29," Yes, but the one I have done now costs 10 rupees, the one I did the other day costs 50 rupees.

920,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,26," Yes sir. So how much is this? I bought it for Rs. 65, so it was Rs. 50 per lot. So how much is it in Rs. 65? Rs. 65? Rs. 65 for 100. You did a trade in F&O that day, it costs Rs. 10 per lot."
921,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,25," I am not saying that it is wrong. I am just explaining that when we buy, it includes brokerage and even if we sell, it includes brokerage. If you sell a share of 10 rupees, then it has 3 rupees, 2 rupees, whatever unit and brokerage it takes. Okay, the brokerage will come after cutting the bill. Madam, it will come after selling for 3 rupees."
922,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,24," Okay. No, he is wrong. I have sold it for 4 rupees and bought it for 13 rupees. I have sold it for 9 rupees and bought it for 8 rupees. So he is wrong."
923,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,23," Sir, I am telling you that whatever you have bought, you have bought it in Rs. 8 but you get insurance by including brokerage in it. Okay. Yes, I was explaining you that only, sir. That is, suppose you have bought a share of Rs. 10, it costs Rs. 3 for your brokerage charges. So Rs. 3 will be left on your account for Rs. 13."
924,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,22, We are not doing this for you.
925,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,21," So what was included in that? Suppose you have bought it for 12 rupees. Madam, I have one more contact. I have bought it. I have bought it. It is showing that I have bought it for 8.06 rupees. And I have sold it for 9.25 rupees."
926,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,20," So, this is what you call buy, it is seen including brokerage. Suppose whatever your 0.02% brokerage is,"
927,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,19," that the 65 lot you have bought in Sensex, you bought it for Rs.13.06. Is it correct sir? No, no, I bought it for Rs.8. It is not correct. I am telling you that, I am explaining you that sir."
928,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,18," Yes, I bought 55 lot that day, so my minus is a little bit down. I was telling you that sir, that you have bought 65 lot in Sensex, that you bought it for 13.06 rupees. No, I bought it for 8 rupees, it is not correct. I am telling you that, I am explaining you that sir."
929,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,17, Okay.
930,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,16, I want to tell you that the quantity of 650 that you have bought in Sensex Okay So the quantity of 10 means one load of 10 quantities is made Okay So you have traded 650 quantity in your 65 load in Sensex And one load of Nifty quantity is made Okay
931,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,15," So there is a law, and the census is? Not the law sir, not the law sir"
932,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,14," No sir, that is not a passive load, it is a load of 65 load, it is a load of 10 quantity. Okay, it is a load of 1 load. And it is a load of 10. Not of 50, sir."
933,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,13," So you paid in that, you bought in the quantity of 650 and you sold in the quantity of 650. You bought 650 in quantity, so you can include the brokerage. I didn't take 650 for the quantity of 650. I told my father that I used to buy only 5 lots. Once I bought a lot of 7 and once I bought a lot of 5. I used to buy 5 lots of both."
934,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,12," Like Nifty Bank is Nifty, right sir? So it is also called as census."
935,a3b7888db8d64493ad551add04dc1e9b,11, What?

1236,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,23," But still I am doing it. I have emails. They just said that I will recover it. So I saved a few trades. So I didn't recover much. So it happened last Friday. I said that I will take 1-2 trades to average. But they bought 25 lots. So you see, this is going to go with me. You must have understood. So this happened."
1237,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,22, So I was not giving that complaint to you.
1238,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,21," Ma'am, yes, she told me to recover your head. Okay? I told her to recover it."
1239,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,20," Sorry ma'am? They guided you wrong, they gave you wrong information regarding the brokerage. Yes, exactly ma'am. So, you spoke to them again, what did they tell you? That they reduced the brokerage, the brokerage has reached 25, but after that, did they commit anything to the refund?"

After that, I bought as many pages as I could in a lot of lots. I had no idea about that. When I asked my RM, my RM officer didn't even know that you were so obsessed. My account was opened from his side, he didn't have my account. So, ma'am, even after that, my decision was going on."
1242,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,17, I did one trade on my own.
1243,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,16," I have a chart too, I had sent the chart of brokerage. It was written 20 per note. I asked him if there were hidden charges after this. He said no sir. I had sent the chart of brokerage, it was written 20 per note. I had taken one trade."
1244,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,15," Brokerage has not given you the information about the brokerage. Because when you trade, the brokerage shows you the amount of rupees you will be paid. So you didn't get confirmation there?"
1245,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,14," I had sent you Rs. 50 for the load at that time. So, you didn't get any information regarding this."
1246,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,13," I am giving you an update. The day this brokerage happened, it was 15 rupees. I have shared all the details in the email. Then they said, I have reduced your brokerage. So after that, my brokerage amount was 25 rupees. So you can check that in the Instagram view. I had been paying you 50 rupees at that time. So regarding this, you had no information."
1247,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,12," This is also an account in the name of Armaan Khan. Okay, so in this, your brokerage is being applied in options, it is being applied according to Rs. 25 per lot. Like you just said, according to Rs. 50 per lot. Yes, sir. You are not going to Rs. 50, sir, 25 is going in options. 25 by 25 per lot. No, sir, I have one objection."
1248,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,11," So, what should I say? What are the options? I will have to go to the study otherwise. Okay sir, I have heard your query. I will check and tell you how much brokerage you have. First, confirm my name. What is your account name?"
1249,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,10," I have been through a lot of difficulties in this. I am asking for a lot of things. And when I got the call, I was also feeling very bad. I went around and found out that the brokerage fee of around Rs. 17,000 has been reduced. I didn't tell them."
1250,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,9," And I had a lot of fraud in the brokerage. I had no response. And my RM was a guy who was recovering from diabetes. I was about to say two or three things. So last Friday, I got a claim that I bought a real plot from him. When I was told that I will buy a real plot."
1251,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,8, I have also complained about it once or twice. That I have not been able to get any help till now.
1252,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,7," I had no idea about the amount of the lot that was bought. I didn't even tell him anything. After that, the next day I checked that I have cut my brokerage by 16800. So when I asked my RM, he gave me the answer that sir, I didn't know that your brokerage is so much free. After that, I asked him why so much lot was bought. He said that I didn't know that I had given the dealer's account. He has bought so much."
1253,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,6," The RM who opened my account, he called me. He said, read 20."
1254,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,5," I was buying in a lot of lots So I bought a trade of 17000 And after that I had overall PL of 270 in profit But I have a brokerage of 16000 And my brokerage fee was 50 rupees per lot And when this account opened, I was told that my brokerage fee is 20 per lot And all these..."
1255,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,4," He took my account. After that, he bought all the stocks and trading that he needed from my account."
1256,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,3," So my accounts, like your, like my RM assigns me."
1257,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,2," Actually, I have an account in your app. Okay. I was offered an account opening through your RM. Okay ma'am. So I was offered an account opening. After that, I was offered an account opening for trading purposes. So ma'am, I added funds."
1258,6c5e96fc1e404cf88b911113a72b2af3,1," What is the name of the company you are working in? Actually, I have an account in your app. Okay. So, I was offered an account opening. You guys went through an RM. Okay, ma'am? So, I was offered an account opening. After that, I was offered an account opening for trading purposes. So, ma'am, I added funds. So, my accounts, like, your, like, I didn't get an RM."
1259,8e96ebdcbc6749ddbb6bc27208f8c8a6,24, Thank you.
1260,8e96ebdcbc6749ddbb6bc27208f8c8a6,23," like for margin something, by checking with dealer team and your payout process will be done and you have mailed, so I will give further process and they giving the information, please wait for sometime and we are prime members, so I can try that your amount will be provided properly, ok sir so wait for sometime"
1261,8e96ebdcbc6749ddbb6bc27208f8c8a6,22," Madam, I am not able to pay that much. The problem is that I am not able to pay that much. For something like margin, check with dealer team and your payout process will be done. And if you have mailed, I will give you the process further.

Okay madam. Thank you."
1262,8e96ebdcbc6749ddbb6bc27208f8c8a6,21," Yes, the same amount that you have given me. And my default in this is that whatever shares I sell should be credited directly to my bank account and not to D-Mate account. No, no sir, we don't do this process. No, then madam, then I am not getting transferred, right? This is the problem. No, no, what actually happens is that amount comes to your D-Mate account and if you want that fund, then you have to pay out that amount."
1263,8e96ebdcbc6749ddbb6bc27208f8c8a6,20," So you can raise that query in the mail. Yes, I will raise it."
1264,8e96ebdcbc6749ddbb6bc27208f8c8a6,19," You can wait, I have already done mail to the consulate. I have already done mail, when you were showing my 8000 for 2-4 days in the margin, so you charged me 33000 interest. Now give me interest of this. So you raise that inquiry on mail. Yes, I raise it."
1265,8e96ebdcbc6749ddbb6bc27208f8c8a6,18," No sir, you wait for a while, I will get it done and see. And I will try to provide you with the amount properly. I had a margin of Rs. 8000, it was showing in it. So you have charged me Rs. 33 interest in it. Okay. Since when have you been holding Rs. 1 lakh, Rs. 1000, Rs. 4000? Who will give the interest?"
1266,8e96ebdcbc6749ddbb6bc27208f8c8a6,17," I think the delay team did that, right? Madam, I will pay only as much as it will come in the amount. Like I will take 75 shares of the choice. So I will add only the amount that will tell you to add. You will get the share and how will it be credited in the account? I have not been able to check that issue because I do not have that much time. But what I am doing, this is also coming for this. So many problems are coming in this app."
1267,8e96ebdcbc6749ddbb6bc27208f8c8a6,16," It will happen on today's date only. Don't worry about that. But there is some cross-stitch. But I don't understand what is the issue. What is the issue? First you resolved one more issue that you got access credit to 75 shares of 75,000. Then you debited it. So I don't understand what is happening."
1268,8e96ebdcbc6749ddbb6bc27208f8c8a6,15," No, I have already emailed you. Please give me some time. Most of the time, if the payout department is cleared from there, then the full amount will be paid out on today's date."
